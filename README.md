Project Title: Financial Performance Dashboard

Project Overview: For my second project in entry-level data science and machine learning, I am developing a comprehensive Financial Performance Dashboard. This project involves analyzing financial data from various departments and locations within a company. The primary objective is to provide stakeholders with an in-depth view of the company's financial health, highlighting key metrics such as revenue, expenses, profit margins, and cash flow. The dashboard will serve as a powerful tool for decision-makers, enabling them to identify trends, assess financial risks, and make strategic decisions to enhance financial stability and growth.
