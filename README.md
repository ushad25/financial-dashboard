# Financial Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
In this project, I, Usha, developed a comprehensive Financial Performance Dashboard to analyze financial data across various departments and locations within a company. Guided by my mentor, Jisma, and using the Entry platform, the primary goal is to provide stakeholders with a detailed view of the company's financial health, focusing on key metrics such as revenue, expenses, profit margins, and cash flow. This dashboard serves as a critical tool for decision-makers, enabling them to identify trends, assess financial risks, and make informed strategic decisions to enhance financial stability and growth.

## Key Tasks

### 1. Data Understanding and Import

- **Key Metrics Identification:** Identified crucial variables and metrics relevant to the financial analysis.
- **Data Import:** Loaded the dataset into Power BI, ensuring it was properly formatted for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Transformation:** Standardized formats (e.g., dates, currency), aggregated data as necessary (e.g., monthly or quarterly summaries), and created new metrics such as profit margin percentage to enrich the analysis.

### 3. Data Modeling
